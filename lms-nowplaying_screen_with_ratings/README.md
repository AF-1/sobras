**Click on the link in the title to see basic installation instructions for your device.** Comes with modified files for the *NowPlaying* applet, one *skin* applet (usually the default one) and rating star images.
<br>

If you use the [**Ratings Light**](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-ratingslight) plugin to **set track ratings** and you change the rating value of the currently playing track anywhere else (another player, web UI), the **displayed rating** on your NowPlaying screen **will only take a moment to update**.
